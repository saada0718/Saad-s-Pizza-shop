# Saad-s-Pizza-shop
The main purpose of this project was for me to learn the basics of backend web development. 
This program provides a person with an option of small, medium, or large pizze.
Moreover, there are 4 different toppings to choose from.
The person has to enter their first and last name along with their address.
If any information is missing the web will notify the user and not proceed until they have entered all the information.
